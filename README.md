An oraganised collection of data.


## Database vs DBMS

App --> DBMS -->Database .(DBMS+DATA eg postgres,oracle)


## what is RDBMS?

A type of database system that stores data in structured tables and uses sql for managing and querying data.

## Databse vs Schemas VS Table

📚 Analogy:
Database = Library 🏛️ → Holds multiple sections (schemas) with different types of books (tables).

Schema = Section in the library 📖 → Groups related bookshelves (tables) together.

Table = Bookshelf 📚 → Stores individual books (records/data) in an organized way

By default, PostgreSQL has a schema called "public", but you can create others for better organization.
